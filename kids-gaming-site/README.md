# Kids Gaming Site

This is a project for a kids gaming website, driven by JSON data.

## Setup

1.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
2.  No build step is required!

## Summary

This project is a simple website that displays a list of games. It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site's content, theme, and branding are all loaded from JSON files in the `data/` directory.

-   `data/branding.json`: Controls the logo, slogan, contact information, and social media links. Update this file to change the site's identity.
-   `data/theme.json`: Defines the color palette and font for the site.
-   `data/games.json`: Contains the list of games, the site's tagline, and the countdown target for new game releases.

## TODO Learning Prompts

-   Open `scripts.js` and complete the student exercise to implement the countdown timer.
-   Modify `styles.css` to change the layout or add animations.
-   Add a new game to `data/games.json` and see it appear on the site.
-   Change the colors in `data/theme.json` to give the site a new look.
-   Update `data/branding.json` with your own information.
